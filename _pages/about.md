Welcome!
======

In Fall 2019, I started a postdoctoral research position with [Dr. Chris Solomon](https://www.caryinstitute.org/science/our-scientists/dr-christopher-t-solomon) at the Cary Institute for Ecosystems Studies. Our project will use existing datasets, including long-term, whole-lake manipulations, to test recently developed theory describing effects of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon and nutrient loads on lake food web productivity (more here!).

I received my Ph.D. in Ecology from Colorado State University where I studied how atmospheric deposition of nutrients and recent climate change have altered the ecology of Colorado mountain lakes. I worked in the Loch Vale Watershed Long-Term Ecological Research & Monitoring Program. In recent years, we have seen a rise in benthic (lake bottom) algal blooms in our subalpine and alpine lakes, and we are doing ongoing work to investigate these changes, both in Loch Vale, as well as in other remote "pristine" lakes.

Are the algae new? What environmental factors contribute to the growth of algae in such clean, clear waters? Are the algae responding to atmospheric N deposition, a warming climate, both, or neither?

To address these questions, we used sediment cores to reconstruct the paleoecology of lakes and conducted in situ and laboratory experiments with temperature and nutrient manipulations to help illuminate the mechanisms by which algal production increases in oligotrophic waters. Paired with empirical data from Loch Vale lakes and snapshot surveys from lakes across the region, we modeled the drivers of lake phytoplankton dynamics through space and time, collectively deepening our understanding of mountain lake ecology.
